# Time-Series Data Analysis using LSTM

This project demonstrates how to apply **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks — a specialized form of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) — to analyze and predict sequential time-series data.  
The goal is to model temporal dependencies in the data and forecast future values with high accuracy using deep learning.

---

## Objectives

- Prepare and normalize sequential time-series datasets.
- Construct and train an LSTM-based neural network using PyTorch or TensorFlow.
- Visualize and evaluate model predictions vs. actual values.
- Explore the use of LSTM in time-series forecasting scenarios like stock prices, temperature data, or sensor readings.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Windowing, normalization, and reshaping for LSTM compatibility.
- **LSTM Model**: Multi-layer architecture to learn temporal dependencies.
- **Training Visualization**: Loss curve and model performance over epochs.
- **Prediction Visualization**: Overlay of predicted vs. actual values for insight into accuracy.
- **Generalizable Structure**: Can be applied to any univariate or multivariate time-series data.

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (depending on your implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Sample Output

> **Dataset**: Daily stock closing prices  
> **Prediction Example**:  
> Predicted and actual price trends plotted on the same graph  
> LSTM captures trend patterns and fluctuations with low error

## Future Work

- Implement multivariate LSTM (with multiple features).
- Experiment with GRU and Bidirectional LSTM architectures.
- Integrate real-time forecasting with live data sources.
